# Decentralized Financial Services Protocol
## Introduction

The financial services sector plays a pivotal role in the global economy, encompassing a wide array of institutions and services that facilitate the management, investment, and movement of money. These services cater to the diverse needs of individuals, businesses, and governments alike. As of today, the financial services sector has evolved and diversified, offering a range of essential services. The financial services sector's continued growth and adaptation to emerging technologies are crucial for fostering economic development and prosperity on a global scale. As technology continues to advance, new types of financial services may emerge, further reshaping the landscape of this vital sector.

The **Decentralized Financial Service Protocol** of DFSP is an adaptation of [beckn protocol](https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications) that aims to unify various financial services that exist today by implementing an interoperable API specification.
